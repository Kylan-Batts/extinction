		<h2>Toad Facts</h2>
		<p>The Golden Toad was found only in Northern Costa Rica, specifically in the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve, a national preserve, in an area encompassing just 6.2 square miles (10 square Kilometers).
The Golden Toad is also known by several other names including the Monteverde Golden Toad, Monte Verde Toad, Orange Toad, and Alajuela Toad.</p>

		<h3>DEATH OF THE TOAD OF GOLDish ORANGE</h3>
		<p>The golden toad may have become extinct because of El Nino. El Nino caused climate change within the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve. The rainfall was the lowest recorded and the temperature also reached record highs. This dry and warm new climate could have caused the toads to become extinct.
		The cause of the extinction could have also been caused by pollution through pesticides.  This theory of extinction states that pollution from pesticides could have caused sexual dimorphism.  This would cause the golden toads to become sterile and unable to reproduce.</p>
